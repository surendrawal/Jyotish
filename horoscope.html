              In astrology, the nine planetary bodies in our nearby planetary
              group each have a ʺPersonalityʺ, an emblematic importance and
              organization behind their energy. As they travel through the
              sky, going through the twelve indications of the zodiac, their
              character comes through differently. On this page, you’ll find
              the significance of every planet, its circles and retrograde
              schedules, just as the communications they make with each
              other-causing lively moves for us here on Earth.

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and
                    self-appreciation, we feel these changes in everything
                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at
                    work. Roughly at regular intervals, the sun travels to
                    another sign and carries with it a new feeling of
                    viewpoint and goals—what we call “seasons.”

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and
                    self-appreciation, we feel these changes in everything
                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at
                    work. Roughly at regular intervals, the sun travels to
                    another sign and carries with it a new feeling of
                    viewpoint and goals—what we call “seasons.”

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and
                    self-appreciation, we feel these changes in everything
                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at
                    work. Roughly at regular intervals, the sun travels to
                    another sign and carries with it a new feeling of
                    viewpoint and goals—what we call “seasons.”

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and
                    self-appreciation, we feel these changes in everything
                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at
                    work. Roughly at regular intervals, the sun travels to
                    another sign and carries with it a new feeling of
                    viewpoint and goals—what we call “seasons.”
