              Nakshatra or Constellation is a combination of two words – Naks
              meaning sky and Shetra meaning region or an area. A Nakshatra is
              a region or area of the sky. They are divisions of 13 degrees 20
              minutes each starting from zero Aries and ending at 30 degree
              Pisces. Together they comprise of 360 degrees. They are sub
              divisions of the zodiac signs and are further sub-divided into 4
              Padas or quarters each. Each Pada has a span of 3 degrees 20
              minutes. Each sign or rashi contains 9 padas. Just as the Sun
              rules the zodiac signs, the Nakshatras are ruled by the moon.
              The moon resides in each Nakshatra for one day as it moves
              approximately 13 degrees 20 minutes in that period. The
              Nakshatras are classified under three main groups-Deva (divine),
              Manusha (Human), Rakshasa (Demonic). They are further divided on
              the basis of gender and ruling deity and gunas. The presence of
              the planets and deities in these Nakshatras determine the true
              nature of an individual. These Nakshatras are read by
              astrologers to find out auspicious dates for cultural or
              religion related events. The Nakshatra in which the moon is
              present at the time of our birth is called the Janma Naksahtra.
              Readings are done keeping on the basis of that.

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and
                    self-appreciation, we feel these changes in everything
                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at
                    work. Roughly at regular intervals, the sun travels to
                    another sign and carries with it a new feeling of
                    viewpoint and goals—what we call “seasons.”

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and
                    self-appreciation, we feel these changes in everything
                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and

                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and
                    self-appreciation, we feel these changes in everything
                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at
                    work. Roughly at regular intervals, the sun travels to

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and
                    self-appreciation, we feel these changes in everything
                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at
                    work. Roughly at regular intervals, the sun travels to
                    another sign and carries with it a new feeling of
                    viewpoint and goals—what we call “seasons.”

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and
                    self-appreciation, we feel these changes in everything
                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at
                    work. Roughly at regular intervals, the sun travels to
                    another sign and carries with it a new feeling of
                    viewpoint and goals—what we call “seasons.”

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and
                    self-appreciation, we feel these changes in everything
                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at
                    work. Roughly at regular intervals, the sun travels to
                    another sign and carries with it a new feeling of
                    viewpoint and goals—what we call “seasons.”

                    The Sun is the most powerful body in Astrology’s sky. It
                    influences the way we express ourselves, our overall
                    energies, and our broad personalities. In Science, the Sun
                    is the center of our solar system, and all the planets
                    orbit around it. Astrology, however, is Earth-centric,
                    meaning it’s based on our perspective of the planets, and
                    their relationship to each other from here on Earth. So,
                    when the Sun shifts from one zodiac sign to the next, it’s
                    not the Sun that is physically moving, but our viewpoint
                    of it — and therefore, our connection to and relationship
                    with its energies from Earth. The sun going through the
                    zodiac makes our opinion about as our prophetic year. In
                    the natal chart, the sun addresses what our identity is
                    and who we endeavour to be. In contrast to the moon, which
                    addresses our passionate reactions, the sun represents our
                    most judicious selves and the manner in which we connect
                    with the world consistently. It additionally decides how
                    we balance the impact of the multitude of different
                    planets as a part of our personality. Regardless of what
                    your sign nonetheless, the sun in each sign conveys some
                    large overall topics that influence everybody in the
                    zodiac. Since the sun rules over the personality and
                    self-appreciation, we feel these changes in everything
                    from our certainty and disposition to our presentation at
                    work. Roughly at regular intervals, the sun travels to
                    another sign and carries with it a new feeling of
                    viewpoint and goals—what we call “seasons.”
