              What is Gemstone?
            </button>
            <div class="panel">
              <div class="mantra-detail">
                <dl>
                  A gemstone (also called a fine gem, jewel, precious
                  stone, or semi-precious stone) is a piece of mineral
                  crystal which, in cut and polished form, is used to make
                  jewelry or other adornments.[1][2][3] However, certain
                  rocks (such as lapis lazuli and opal) and occasionally
                  organic materials that are not minerals (such as amber,
                  jet, and pearl) are also used for jewelry and are
                  therefore often considered to be gemstones as well. Most
                  gemstones are hard, but some soft minerals are used in
                  jewelry because of their luster or other physical
                  properties that have aesthetic value. Rarity and
                  notoriety are other characteristics that lend value to
                  gemstones.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The traditional classification in the West, which goes
                  back to the ancient Greeks, begins with a distinction
                  between precious and semi-precious; similar distinctions
                  are made in other cultures. In modern use, the precious
                  stones are diamond, ruby, sapphire and emerald, with all
                  other gemstones being semi-precious.[4] This distinction
                  reflects the rarity of the respective stones in ancient
                  times, as well as their quality: all are translucent
                  with fine color in their purest forms, except for the
                  colorless diamond, and very hard, with hardnesses of 8
                  to 10 on the Mohs scale. Other stones are classified by
                  their color, translucency, and hardness. The traditional
                  distinction does not necessarily reflect modern values;
                  for example, while garnets are relatively inexpensive, a
                  green garnet called tsavorite can be far more valuable
                  than a mid-quality emerald.[5] Another unscientific term
                  for semi-precious gemstones used in art history and
                  archaeology is hardstone. Use of the terms 'precious'
                  and 'semi-precious' in a commercial context is,
                  arguably, misleading in that it deceptively implies
                  certain stones are intrinsically more valuable than
                  others, which is not necessarily the case.

            <div class="panel">
              <div class="mantra-detail">

                  A horoscope (or other commonly used names for the
                  horoscope in English include natal chart, astrological
                  chart, astro-chart, celestial map, sky-map, star-chart,
                  cosmogram, vitasphere, radical chart, radix, chart wheel
                  or simply chart) is an astrological chart or diagram
                  representing the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets,
                  astrological aspects and sensitive angles at the time of
                  an event, such as the moment of a person's birth. The
                  word horoscope is derived from the Greek words ōra and
                  scopos meaning "time" and "observer" (horoskopos, pl.
                  horoskopoi, or "marker(s) of the hour"). It is used as a
                  method of divination regarding events relating to the
                  point in time it represents, and it forms the basis of
                  the horoscopic traditions of astrology.
                  <br><br>
                  In common usage, horoscope often refers to an
                  astrologer's interpretation, usually based on a system
                  of solar Sun sign astrology; based strictly on the
                  position of the Sun at the time of birth, or on the
                  calendar significance of an event, as in Chinese
                  astrology. In particular, many newspapers and magazines
                  carry predictive columns, written in prose that may be
                  written more for increasing readership than tied
                  directly to the Sun or other aspects of the solar
                  system, allegedly based on celestial influences in
                  relation to the zodiacal placement of the Sun on the
                  month of birth, cusp (2 days before or after any
                  particular sign, an overlap), or decant (the month
                  divided into 3 ten-day periods) of the person's month of
                  birth, identifying the individual's Sun sign or "star
                  sign" based on the tropical zodiac.

                  Predictive Astrology is a science in which the positive
                  and negative effects of planets and constellations on
                  humans and Earth are studied in detail. The yogic
                  meaning of the word “Jyotisha” is the discipline which
                  is related to the planets and constellations. However,
                  from this word, Mathematics (Siddhanta) is also
                  understood. But generally, people associate Astrology
                  with the predictive approach only. Have a Finance Report
