              In astrology, the nine planetary bodies in our nearby planetary
              group each have a ʺPersonalityʺ, an emblematic importance and
              organization behind their energy. As they travel through the
              sky, going through the twelve indications of the zodiac, their
              character comes through differently. On this page, you’ll find
              the significance of every planet, its circles and retrograde
              schedules, just as the communications they make with each
              other-causing lively moves for us here on Earth.

                    positions at the time of one’s birth which is very helpful
                    to understand many aspects of one’s personality, career,

                    of an individual is perhaps the most sought for parts of
                    astrology. A Kundali involves the insights concerning the
                    places of stars and planets at the time of your birth to
                    the world dependent on which further expectations are
                    made. What’s more, with additional expectations we mean
                    forecasts about various parts of one’s life like love,
                    vocation, wellbeing, business, finance and even marriage.
                    Simply, Kundali making is something important for any
                    individual and is probably going to further develop their

                    However, the world, in recent times, has grown up to
                    develop a very wrong perception about Kundali matching.
                    Couples, especially the ones who dream of a love marriage,
                    find Kundali matching as a obstacle in their relationship.
                    Many of them are scared of the questions that would arise
                    if their kundalis don’t match and thus find ways to skip
                    the gun milan ritual. However, this perception of the
                    couples about kundali matching is nothing but merely wrong
                    facts also known as half baked knowledge that have been
                    forced into their minds. Honestly speaking, astrology
                    never works as a bone of contention for your relationship.
                    Instead, if you ever talk to an astrologer and ask them
                    about your relationship, they will only introduce you to
                    ways using which you can better your relationship. Our

                    Gemstones are considered powerful objects in Astrology.
                    They hold hidden reserves of energy which can alter the
                    course of your destiny. Gemstones can ward off negative
                    influence of malefic planets and boost the positive
                    effects of benefic planets, thus help you to fill your
                    life with success and happiness. Here you are offered a
                    wide range of primary gemstones. You can buy them to fix a
                    variety of problems like lack of opportunities, shortage
                    of wealth and fortune, or simply to ensure all-round
                    well-being and a surge of positivity in your life.
                    Similarly, if we have certain ambitions in life, then the
                    gemstones act like catalysts, and help us to reach closer
                    to our destination. These wonder remedies can even help to
